# applied-machine-learning

Mini-projects undertaken during the "INFO 251: Applied Machine Learning" course at UC Berkeley.

Each of folders in this repository contains a separate mini-project. For the most part, the included Jupyter notebooks are well-documented and should be understandable by most audiences.

* PS1
    * A very basic exploration of the [Boston Housing Prices dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names).

* PS2
    * Hypothesis tests to evaluate the impact of the [Progresa program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oportunidades) - a government social assistance program in Mexico.

* PS3
    * Using k-nearest neighbours to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes in the [Boston Housing Prices dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/housing.names).

* PS4
    * Similar to PS3, but using gradient descent linear regression with regularization.

* PS5
    * Using a naive Bayes classifier to predict whether a movie is 'fresh' or 'rotten' on Rotten Tomatoes.

* PS6
    * Using decision trees and random forests to predict survival on the Titanic.

* PS7
    * Using k-means clustering and principal components analysis to recognize faces in the [Faces in the Wild dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/).
